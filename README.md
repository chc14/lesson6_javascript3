### Project Description:
(In this assignment, Document Object Models were introduced. Without DOM, JavaScript would  not be capable of creating the HTML codes. Using DOM, this assignment teaches how to create a photo gallery. )

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (In this lesson I learned what DOM was and how important it is to JavaScript. Navigating structure and adding/removing elements is the main function of the DOM. The DOM structure looks similar to that of a tree table.)
2. (Accessing elements by their tag name is a useful tool I learned in this assignment. Much of the assignment utilized elements and without tag names or ID's this would have been extremely difficult. Once I gained access to the elemnt tag, I was able to change specific attributes.)
3. (Adding document nodes was a brand new lesson introduced to me in this assignment. The code appendChild was used to add child nodes, and the node becomes appended. The appended node will appear after any previously appended nodes. )
